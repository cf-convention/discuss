# CF metadata discussions
A forum for proposing standard names, asking questions about the interpretation and use of the CF conventions, and suggestions for proposals to change or extend the CF conventions.
To get started, create a [new issue](https://github.com/cf-convention/discuss/issues/new/choose).

A complete proposal for an enhancement to the CF conventions (that may have well started as a conversation on this forum) should be raised as an issue on the cf-conventions repository: https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-conventions/issues
