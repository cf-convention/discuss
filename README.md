# CF metadata discussions
A forum for proposing standard names, any discussion about the interpretation and use of the CF conventions, and suggestions for proposals to change or extend the CF conventions.

A complete proposal for an enhancement to the CF conventions (that may have well started as a converstation on this forum) should be raised as an issue on the cf-conventions repository: https://github.com/cf-convention/cf-conventions/issues
