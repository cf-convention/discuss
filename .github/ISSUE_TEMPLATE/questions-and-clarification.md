Please use CF GitHub organization Discussions (https://github.com/orgs/cf-convention/discussions/new?category=q-a-about-using-cf) if you would like to ask a question about the interpretation and use of the CF conventions or for clarification about some aspect of CF. (We are trying out GitHub Discussions as a possible replacement for the use of GitHub Issues for asking questions.) Thanks.
