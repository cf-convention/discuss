Before submitting an issue be sure you have read and understood the rules for vocabulary changes: http://cfconventions.org/standard_name_rules.html

Please note that it is fine to group together a number of proposals in a single GitHub issue (i.e. it is not necessary to open a separate issue for each vocabulary term). Change proposals should include the following information as applicable.

**Proposer's name** This information will be used to add entries to the vocabulary editor: http://cfeditor.ceda.ac.uk/proposals/1. If you prefer not to add your name, your github id will be used instead.
**Date** Also used in the vocabulary editor.
For each term please try to give the following:
**- Term** Proposed term to appear in the vocabulary
**- Description** A brief description to explain the meaning of the term
**- Units** (If applicable).
